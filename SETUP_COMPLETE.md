## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Backend Fixes:
1. **✅ Fixed db.js module export** - Changed from `getPool()` method to direct pool export
2. **✅ Added comprehensive error logging** - All API routes now log errors with detailed messages
3. **✅ Configured CORS properly** - Set to allow `http://localhost:3000` with credentials
4. **✅ Added global error handler** - Server now catches and logs all unhandled errors
5. **✅ Created seed script** - Populates database with 5 sample courses

### Frontend Fixes:
1. **✅ API_URL configuration** - Both AdminDashboard and Courses use correct backend URL
2. **✅ Dynamic course fetching** - Courses page displays real-time data from database
3. **✅ Full CRUD operations** - AdminDashboard can Create, Read, Update, Delete courses

## 🚀 How to Run Your Application

### Step 1: Start XAMPP MySQL
- Open XAMPP Control Panel
- Start MySQL service
- Ensure it's running on port 3306

### Step 2: Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Server listening on port 5000
📡 API available at http://localhost:5000/api
Database is created successfully or already exists.
Database schema (tables) are created successfully or already exist.
Database connected to backend successfully.
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend (in a new terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Frontend will open at:** `http://localhost:3000`
